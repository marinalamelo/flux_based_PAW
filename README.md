# flux_based_PAW
# To run the software to calculate flux-based plant available water, download the executable file "FluxPAW_3.2.exe" and the input files "Input.txt" and "Soil.txt". Place them in the same folder of the software.
# Change the soil hydraulic parameters and the soil-plant-atmosphere parameters in the respective input files. Keep files formatting.
# 'RESULTS.txt' is an example of the model output. If you download it, the program will overwrite the file after running.
# Important: depending on Windows version and installation options (if you get an error message on running the Fortran executable), it may be necessary to download the Fortran libraries libifcoremd.dll (64bit) and libmmd.dll (64bit) into the System32 directory on your PC. The files can be downloaded from here: 
www.dll-files.com/search/?q=libifcoremd.dll
www.dll-files.com/search/?q=libmmd.dll
# Share the software with your partners!
# A web version of the program is available at: https://marinalamelo.github.io/flux_based_PAW/
# Please test and suggest improvements.
